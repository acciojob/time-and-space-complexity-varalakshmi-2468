	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
        An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it can handle larger inputs faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run relative to its input size. 
        For example, an algorithm with space usage of O(n) grows linearly with the input. 
        Understanding Space Complexity helps us design programs that use memory efficiently.
